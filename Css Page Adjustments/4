Padding is the space between the content and the border of an element. It is used to create space around the content of the element.

Margin is the space outside the border of an element. It is used to create space between elements.

In CSS, padding and margin can be specified in pixels, percentages, or other units.

For example:

Padding: 10px;
Margin: 20px;
